> Create an Angular component (not directive!) that wraps the Wistia uploader. It should do the following:
 * Click an upload button
 * Pick a file
 * The widget uploads the file to Wistia, showing progress in a progress bar of some sort
 * Once the file completes uploading, it shows as an embedded Wistia video player.
